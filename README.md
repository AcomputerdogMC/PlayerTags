# PlayerTags - A bukkit plugin to give name tags and colors to players
---
PlayerTags is a simple plugin to give mod, admin, and year-long player bages to players, with an additional feature of allowing them to set a color for their name.  Year badges are calculated autmotaically, or can be forced with the permission "playertags.forceyear".  Mod and admin badges are enabled with "playertags.ismod" and "playertags.isadmin", respectively.  Tags include both an uncolored version for the player list and a colored one for chat.  They can be set in the configuration file.
